\section{How to compile}
Suppose that ZPar has been downloaded to the directory \textit{zpar}. To make a dependency parsing system for English, type \textit{make english.depparser}. This will create a directory \textit{zpar/dist/english.depparser}, in which there are two files: \textit{train} and \textit{depparser}. The file \textit{train} is used to train a parsing model,and the file \textit{depparser} is used to parse new texts using a trained parsing model. Similarly, we can make a dependency parsing system for Chinese by typing \textit{make chinese.depparser}. The \textit{train} and \textit{depparser} files are created under the directory of \textit{zpar/dist/chinese.depparser}.
\section{Format of inputs and outputs}
The input file to the \textit{train} executable contains a set of parse trees. An example parse tree is as follows:
\\
\\
%\begin{tabular}{l}
\hspace{3cm} Ms. \hspace{2cm} NNP \hspace{2cm} 1 \\
\hspace{3cm} Haag \hspace{1.6cm} NNP \hspace{2cm} 2 \\
\hspace{3cm} plays \hspace{1.2cm} VBZ \hspace{2cm} -1 \\
\hspace{3cm} Elianti \hspace{0.8cm} NNP \hspace{2cm} 2 \\
\hspace{3cm} . \hspace{2cm} . \hspace{2cm} 2 \\
\\
Here the first column represents the words of the sentence; the second column contains POS tags of the words; the third column represents the indices of the heads of the words. Indices start from 0. For example, the head index of the word \textit{Ms.} is 1, which means its head is \textit{Haag}. The head index for the root word of the sentences is -1. Note that, in each line tab characters are used to separate a word, a POS tag, and an index.
\\
\\
The input file to the \textit{depparser} executable contains POS tagged sentences. The formats for English and Chinese are different.
\\
\\
\hspace{2cm} \textbf{English}: \\
\hspace{3cm} Ms./NNP Haag/NNP plays/VBZ Elianti/NNP\\
\\
\hspace{2cm}\textbf{Chinese}: \\
\hspace{3cm} ZPar$\_$NR 可以$\_$MD 分析$\_$VV 中文$\_$NN 和$\_$CC 英文$\_$NN \\
\\
For Chinese, inputs to both \textit{train} and \textit{depparser} must be encoded in \textit{utf8}.
\section{How to train a model}
To train a model, use
\\
\\
\hspace{3cm} zpar/dist/english.depparser/train $<$train-file$>$ $<$model-file$>$ $<$number of iterations$>$ \\
\\
For example, using the English \href{eng_dep_files/train.txt}{example train file}, you can train a  model by
\\
\\
\hspace{3cm} zpar/dist/english.depparser/train train.txt model 1 \\
\\
After training is completed, a new file \textit{model} will be created in the current directory, which can be used to parse POS-tagged sentences. The above command performs training with one iteration (see Section~\ref{tuning}) using the training file.
\\
\\
The commands for training Chinese parsing models are the same. For example, using the Chinese \href{chn_dep_files/train.txt}{example train file}, you can train a model by
\\
\\
\hspace{3cm} zpar/dist/chinese.depparser/train train.txt model 1 \\
\section{How to parse new texts}
To apply an existing model to parse new texts, use
\\
\\
\hspace{3cm} zpar/dist/english.depparser/depparser $<$model$>$ $<$input-file$>$ $<$output-file$>$
\\
\\
For example, using the model we just trained, we can parse \href{eng_dep_files/input.txt}{an example input} by
\\
\\
\hspace{3cm} zpar/dist/english.depparser/depparser model input.txt output.txt
\\
\\
The output file contains automatically parsed trees. The commands for parsing Chinese texts are the same. See an example of \href{chn_dep_files/input.txt}{Chinese input file}.
\section{Outputs and evaluation}
In order to evaluate the quality of the outputs, we can manually specify the gold parse trees of a sample, and compare the outputs with the correct sample.
\\
Manually specified parse trees of the input file are given in \href{eng_dep_files/reference.txt}{this example reference file} (find a Chinese reference file \href{chn_dep_files/reference.txt}{here}).  Here is a \href{eng_dep_files/evaluate.py}{Python script} that performs automatic evaluation.
\\
\\
Using the above \textit{output.txt} and \textit{reference.txt}, we can evaluate the accuracies by typing
\\
\\
\hspace{3cm} python evaluate.py output.txt reference.txt
\\
\\
You can find the precision, recall, and f-score here. See the explanation of these measures on \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall}{Wikipedia}.
\section{How to tune the performance of a system}
\label{tuning}
The performance of the system after one training iteration may not be optimal. You can try training a model for another few iterations, after each you compare the performance. You can choose the model that gives the highest f-score on your test data. We conventionally call this test file the development test data, because you develop a parsing model using this. Here is a \href{eng_dep_files/test.sh}{a shell script} that automatically trains the parser for 30 iterations, and after the $i$th iteration, stores the model file to model.$i$. You can compare the f-score of all 30 iterations and choose model.$k$, which gives the best f-score, as the final model. In this file, this is a variable called \textit{zpar}. You need to set this variable to the relative directory of \textit{zpar/dist/english.depparsr} or \textit{zpar/dist/chinese.depparser}.
