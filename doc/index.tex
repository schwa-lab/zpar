\section{Overview}

ZPar is a statistical natural language parser, which performs syntactic analysis tasks including word segmentation, part-of-speech tagging and parsing. ZPar supports multiple languages and multiple grammar formalisms. ZPar has been most heavily developed for Chinese and English, while it provides generic support for other languages. A Romanian model has been trained for ZPar 0.2, for example. ZPar currently supports context free grammars (CFG), dependency grammars and combinatory categorial grammars (CCG).
